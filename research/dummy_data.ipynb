Perhaps they will reap the benefits down the road.\\nDo you really think they would have done what they did if they\\nwere competing for a pennant?\\n\\n\\nFor a stat-head, I'm amazed that you put any credence in spring\\ntraining.  Did you notice who he got those 10 (!) hits off of, or\\nare you going to tell me that it doesn't make a difference?\\n\\n\\nWait a minute.  I missed something here.  First, forget Keith\\nMitchell.  Are you saying that a kid who moves from AA to AAA\\nand then does not improve would have been better off making a\\ndirect leap to the majors?  If a player does well at AA and then\\ndoes not improve at AAA, isn't that a sign that maybe he doesn't\\nbelong in the bigs?\\n\\nNow, Keith Mitchell.  As I recall (no stat books handy - surprise!)\\nhe jumped from AA to Atlanta in 1991.  He did so well that he was\\nreturned to the minors, where he didn't do very well at all.  Now\\nhis career is in jeopardy.  So how does he fit in with your \\npoint.  Good MLE's in AA.  Moved him right to the big club.  Now\\nhe's one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball.\\nDuh.\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I've cast my lot.  Certainly you may understand better how \\ngood Lopez is.  And I may overvalue experience.  But neither one\\nof us runs a baseball team.\\n\\n\\n\\n--\\tThe Beastmaster\\n\\n\",\n",

It was the game\\nwhere Pendelton broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a two-out,\\ntwo-run homer to right to win it.  (It wasn\\'t the game where the fans\\nthrew the give-away \"fotoballs\" onto the field in response to the homer --\\ntoo bad, huh?)\\n\\nWell, the \\'Stick is still cold.  The Saturday game ended at 5:45pm, and it\\nwas cold then.  I can\\'t imagine night games in April at the \\'Stick.  The\\nwind kicked up a little, too, and I got this idea.\\n\\nAt most games, there\\'s a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on\\nthe field a lot of the time.  I propose a Kid\\'s Clean-up Corps composed\\nmainly of 10-12 year old kids who would love nothing better than to run\\nout on the field in the fifth inning (when the guy in the Toro smooths\\nthe infield) and grab the trash.\\n\\nIt might not be glamorous, but at that age I probably would have given\\nanything to be on the field with the ballplayers.  Everybody wins here!\\n\\nWhaddaya think?',\n",
       " '\\nNot really, though I wouldn\\'t personally say \"the most deserving\\ncandidate wins\".  Rarely does a player win ROY when called up in mid\\nseason, and there have been several duds in recent years.  But this is\\nmore a factor of mediot biases than anything else.  (I wonder.  If\\nAmaral hits like he is capable of, will he receive ROTY votes?  He\\'s\\nonly 31, he could have a long career ahead of him!  :-)\\n\\n\\nI think they are a second-division team.  They should finish ahead of\\nthe Royals, Mariners, and *possibly* Athletics.  But I don\\'t think\\nthey\\'ll be above .500.  (I think the East is stronger this year.)\\n\\nLast year their pitching was bad and their offense was horrible.  This\\nyear their offense is better, but their pitching is still pretty bad.\\nEven if Finley returns to form, he won\\'t replace what they lost in\\nAbbott.  Sanderson?  Farrell?  I don\\'t believe it.\\n\\nAnd while their BA may be good, and they have decent speed, their\\noffense lacks punch.  They don\\'t have any bona fide power hitters.\\n(Salmon, Snow, Davis, and Curtis?  None with more than 20 HR\\npotential.)\\n\\nCheers,\\n-Valentine',\n",
       " '\\nCan anybody name a player who was \\'rushed\\' to the majors (let\\'s, for\\nargument\\'s sake, define \"rushed\" as brought up to the majors for more than\\na cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger, and performing below\\nexpectations), whose career was damaged by this rushing?  I\\'m serious; I\\ntend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but\\nI\\'d like to look at players for whom this theory didn\\'t work, if there are\\nany.  I\\'d prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can\\nlook up their minor league stats.  (It\\'s important to distinguish between\\nplayers who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers\\nwould have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but\\nactually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).  \\n\\nLet\\'s kick it off with an example of a player who was \"rushed\", although\\nthere doesn\\'t seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell was\\ngiven 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what\\nyou would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs the\\nnext year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, at\\nage 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job,\\nand has been there ever since.  It\\'s really hard for me to see where he\\nwould have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was\\nperformed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being \"rushed\";\\nCleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have\\nbeen less likely to give up on him.\\n\\nYes, if you bring a player up early, he\\'s likely going to struggle.  But\\ndoes that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and starts\\nperforming up to expectations?',\n",

       " '\\n\\nI know it\\'s very trendy nowadays to dump on Morris, but let\\'s give credit\\nwhere credit is due.\\n\\nIt is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the AL east without Morris.\\nLast year, when the team went 13-15 for the month of August, and all the \\nother starters were being shelled, and Milwaukee was making a charge,\\nMorris went 5-1 with a pretty good era (I can\\'t remember exactly).\\nAlso, let\\'s not underestimate the importance his 240+ innings to save \\nthe bullpen every fifth day.

I do remember Morris winning an inordinate number of\\n6-5 and 8-6 ballgames, but this is to his credit.  He pitched only as good\\nas he needed to be.  When he was up 6-1 in a ballgame, he just put it in cruise\\ncontrol and threw the ball up there and let the batters \"get themseleves out\"\\n(I hate this expression!).  An inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out \\ntrying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down.  But Morris, being a \\nveteran pitcher, knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in\\nbaseball.  By saving himself, he was able to reach back for that little extra\\n(I hate this too!) when the game was on the line.\\n\\nYes Morris is crapping out big time this year, but let\\'s not change history\\nto suit the present.  \\n\\nBTW, I think he should be put in the bullpen; it would be embarrassing a \\nveteran pitcher which Cito would never do, but his era is 17+, how much more\\ncan he be embarrassed?\\n\\n\\nditto!\\n',\n",
